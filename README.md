# Real-time Pose-Based Fitness Tracker

This project utilizes MediaPipe, OpenCV, and a pose estimation module to create a real-time fitness tracker focusing on counting dumbbell curls. The user stands in front of a camera, and the program calculates the angle between the shoulder, elbow, and wrist to determine the movement direction and count the number of curls performed.
